# Manual Test Plan

## 1. Introduction
This document describes the manual testing approach, scope, and objectives for testing a sample web application. The goal is to ensure that core functionalities work as expected and defects are identified early.

## 2. Application Under Test (AUT)
A sample web-based application used for QA practice and portfolio demonstration. The application includes basic user interactions such as form submission and data display.

## 3. Test Objectives
- Verify that application features function according to requirements
- Identify functional and UI defects
- Ensure proper input validation and error handling
- Improve overall product quality through structured testing

## 4. Testing Scope

### In Scope
- Functional testing of core features
- UI validation
- Form field validation
- Error messages and alerts

### Out of Scope
- Performance testing
- Security testing
- Automation testing
- Compatibility testing across multiple browsers

## 5. Test Approach
Manual testing will be conducted using black-box testing techniques. Test cases will be designed based on requirements and executed to validate expected behavior.

## 6. Test Environment
- Browser: Google Chrome
- Operating System: Windows
- Test Data: Sample user input data

## 7. Entry Criteria
- Application is accessible
- Functional requirements are available
- Test environment is ready

## 8. Exit Criteria
- All planned test cases executed
- Critical and high-severity defects logged
- Test results reviewed

## 9. Test Deliverables
- Manual test plan
- Test cases
- Bug reports
- Test execution results

## 10. Risks and Assumptions
- Requirements may change during testing
- Limited access to production-like data
- Testing performed on a single browser

## 11. Roles and Responsibilities
- QA Tester: Design and execute test cases, report defects
- Developer: Fix reported defects
- Stakeholders: Review test outcomes
